# Data Science Project | Common Vulnerability Exposures 

CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. This project analyzes the different fluctuations in the Cyber Security world.

For this project, we used [cvedetails.com](https://www.cvedetails.com/), which provides an easy-to-use web interface for CVE vulnerability data. You can browse for vendors, products and versions and view CVE entries, and vulnerabilities related to them. You can view statistics about vendors, products and versions of products. CVE details are displayed on a single, easy-to-use page, see a sample here.

CVE vulnerability data are taken from National Vulnerability Database (NVD) XML feeds provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Additional data from several sources like exploits from www.exploit-db.com, vendor statements and additional vendor-supplied data, and Metasploit modules are also published in addition to NVD CVE data.

## Phase 1 - Project Proposal

**Research question** - The question is what is the connection between the severity score of security vulnerabilities and the rising of new technologies in the web surface.

Over the last decade, web technology has evolved significantly, enterprises are developing new services which expand the exposure of the enterprises' services to the internet.

At the same time, the cyber and information security field has adapted itself. As a result, every year different vulnerabilities are being discovered at different levels of severity and importance.

We intend to find out if the numerical value of severity score of new security vulnerabilities may be predicted based on previous vulnerabilities data through the last decade. 

**Features** – 13 columns are mentioned below:

* CVE ID (CVE-<Year>-<ID>)

* Vulnerability Type (Types of vulnerabilities such as Bypass, DOS, XSS, etc.)

* Publish Date (Date)

* Update Date (Date)

* Score (Severity of vulnerability – 1.0-10.0)

* Gained Access Level (None \ Partial \ Complete)

* Access (Local \ Remote)

* Complexity (Low \ Medium \ High)

* Authentication (Required \ Not required)

* Confidentiality (None \ Partial \ Complete)

* Integrity (None \ Partial \ Complete)

* Availability (None \ Partial \ Complete)

**Instances** – over 50,000 rows, each row will contain information about a vulnerability.

**Data sources** –

[cvedetails.com](https://www.cvedetails.com/) - Security vulnerability database/information source. In that website we can view various details (Vulnerability score, access level, complexity, integrity, etc.) regarding vulnerabilities throughout the years,

[vulndb.com](https://vulndb.cyberriskanalytics.com/) - Comprehensive and timely vulnerability intelligence which provides actionable information about the latest vulnerabilities in security field.

[rapid7.com](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) - Technical details for over 180,000 vulnerabilities.


**Data mining methods** – API and crawling from various websites such as: CVE Details, VulnDB, Rapid7. Libraries – BeautifulSoup, Requests, pandas.

**Planned visualizations** – 2D visualizations, based on different methods which we have learned during our course. For example: pie charts, scatter plots etc.

**Planned models** - Linear Regression.

**Validation methods** – R2.


## Phase 2 - Scraping
Inside **crawling()** function we are:
* Creating a .CSV file in order to write all the data acquired from cvedetails.com.
* Editing the .CSV file with the right fitted columns names.
* Using 10 different URLs, which are relevant for us to acquire valuable data from the site.
* Inside the root loop, we are iterating every URL and creating a BeautifulSoup “soup” in order to acquire the relevant data.
* Inside the soup, we scraped the data into variables and typed it into the .CSV file.

## Phase 3 - Data Manipulation


## Phase 4 - Analyzing the data
In the first stage, we wanted to present the increase of the CVEs over the last decade.

### 1. Increase In The Number Of CVEs
The **visualize_CVE_amount_increase()** function visualizes a live evidence of the increase. The number of CVEs coming up the ramp during the last decade.

ADD PIC

Therefore, we can determine that there is a clear connection between the rising of technology during the last decade, to the number of CVEs.

### 2. Average Score Per Year
The **visualize_average_score_per_year()** function visualizes the average CVE score, according to Common Vulnerability Scoring System, CVSS, which is a vulnerability scoring system designed to provide an open and standardized method for rating IT vulnerabilities. 

CVSS helps organizations prioritize and coordinate a joint response to security vulnerabilities by communicating the base, temporal and environmental properties of a vulnerability.

CVSS is composed of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and Environmental, each consisting of a set of metrics.
These metric groups are described as follows:
Base: represents the intrinsic and fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and in user environments.

**Temporal**: represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time but not among user environments.
**Environmental**: represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are relevant and unique to a particular user's environment.
The purpose of the CVSS base group is to define and communicate the fundamental characteristics of a vulnerability. This objective approach to characterizing vulnerabilities provides users with a clear and intuitive representation of a vulnerability. Users can then invoke the temporal and environmental groups to provide contextual information that more accurately reflects the risk to their unique environment. This allows them to make more informed decisions when trying to mitigate risks posed by the vulnerabilities.

ADD PIC

**With the help of the Scatter Plot, we may see that:**
* At the beginning of the last decade, the average score was higher than at the end of the decade
* In the last 5 years, there is a decrease in the average CVE score.
* Over the last 2 years, there is an up-sweep in the average score.

### 3. Yearly Score Distribution
The **visualize_yearly_score_distribution(ds, year)** function allows us to take a look at the score distribution for every year. In the Jupiter Notebook, we presented last 7 years. 

ADD PIC

**We came to the conclusion that:**
* The majority of the vulnerabilities are in the score range of 4-8.
* There are small changes in the score distribution over the years.

### 4. CVE Score Distribution For The Last Decade
The **visualize_score_distribution()** function presents the score distribution according to the last decade.

This graph visualizes the ratio between the CVE score to the number of times a CVE was published with that CVE score.

**With the help of the Scatter Plot, we may see that:**
* The majority of the vulnerabilities are in the score range of 4-8.
* The small numbers are in the range of 0-4 and 8-10.

### 5. Low Hanging Fruits - Stats
The **visualize_stats()** function visualizes a pie chart and presents the distribution of:
* CVE Access Types
* CVE Complexity Types
* CVE Confidentiality Types
* CVE Integrity Types
* CVE Availability Types

About all CVEs in the last decade.
  
**With the help of these Pie Charts, we may see that:**
* Most of the Access types are exploited remotely.
* The complexity of the CVEs is Low/Medium at most.
* There are 16.6% to succeed in exploiting a vendor with known CVE - according to the Confidentiality pie chart.
* The is a partial integrity majority in all CVEs over the last decade.
* There is an equality between partial available CVES to the ones that are not available.
